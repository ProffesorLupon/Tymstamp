# Tymstamp
Tymstamp is a proximity-based attendance and travel log system that uses GPS and facial recognition to ensure accurate, 
tamper-proof employee tracking. Built with Flutter (mobile), Laravel (backend), and MySQL (database), 
it supports real-time compliance scoring, travel reimbursement, and leave management through both web and mobile platforms.
